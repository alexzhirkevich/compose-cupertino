Compose Cupertino is a Kotlin Multiplatform library for the [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) UI framework.
It provides various UI components for making native-looking iOS applications, including
- `cupertino` - Compose Multiplatform implementation of iOS-like Cupertino theme and widgets, based on compose.foundation. Inspired by compose.material3 and SwiftUI APIs;
- `cupertino-native` - UIKit native wrappers for Cupertino Widgets. Allows to seamlessly use some UIKit widgets for iOS and their equivalents from cupertino for other platforms;
- `cupertino-adaptive` - adaptive theme and wrappers for Cupertino and Material3 widgets. Allows to seamlessly use both widgets from shared code with correct content color and font style;
- `cupertino-icons-extended` - more than 800 most used monochrome [Apple SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) as Compose ImageVectors.
These symbols are copyrighted. Please read licence agreement first.
If you don't need these icons for platform other than iOS, you can use ios bundled icons using converters from cupertino-native. 
- `cupertino-decompose` - iOS-like swipe-back animation for the 'predictive back' navigation feature of the [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose) library + `NativeChildren` wrapper over `UINavigationController`.
Provides native-feeling or truly native page transitions and swipe gestures.
